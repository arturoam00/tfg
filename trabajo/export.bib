   abstract = {Induced responses to herbivores in plants are thought to be a form of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, whereby plants save metabolic costs by expressing defenses only when they are necessary. Although costs of being inducible have never been examined, there have been many studies of costs of induced responses, with approaches ranging from the manipulation of induction with herbivores or wounding, and more recently, with chemical elicitors. While some early studies reported no significant costs of induced responses, evidence for significant costs of induced responses in both wild and agricultural species has recently increased in the literature. Recent studies have made it clear that benefits of induced responses in the field in the presence of herbivores can counterbalance costs of induced responses seen in the absence of herbivores. Moreover, as has been shown for constitutive resistance, costs of induced responses may vary with environmental conditions, including the presence of competitors and altered resource availability. Ecological costs of induced responses may include increased susceptibility to untargeted herbivores, either through the altered attraction of specific herbivores or due to defense pathway cross-talk, but the actual fitness consequences of such ecological costs have been little studied. Mutant and transgenic plants altered in induced responses are increasingly being identified or produced, as are specific elicitors of direct and indirect defenses. Their use, coupled with the increasing ability to analyze global gene expression in plants, will advance studies on the specificity, magnitude, and mechanisms of costs of induced responses.},

   abstract = {The potential consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning and services at local scales have received considerable attention during the last decade, but little is known about how biodiversity affects ecosystem processes and stability at larger spatial scales. We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer-resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.},

@article{Kerr2002,
   abstract = {One of the central aims of ecology is to identify mechanisms that maintain biodiversity1, 2. Numerous theoretical models have shown that competing species can coexist if ecological processes such as dispersal, movement, and interaction occur over small spatial scales1-10. In particular, this may be the case for nontransitive communities, that is, those without strict competitive hierarchies3, 6, 8, 11. The classic non-transitive system involves a community of three competing species satisfying a relationship similar to the children's game rock-paper-scissors, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Such relationships have been demonstrated in several natural systems12-14. Some models predict that local interaction and dispersal are sufficient to ensure coexistence of all three species in such a community, whereas diversity is lost when ecological processes occur over larger scales6, 8. Here, we test these predictions empirically using a non-transitive model community containing three populations of Escherichia coli. We find that diversity is rapidly lost in our experimental community when dispersal and interaction occur over relatively large spatial scales, whereas all populations coexist when ecological processes are localized.},

   abstract = {Understanding how dispersal influences the dynamics of spatially distributed populations is a major priority of both basic and applied ecologists. Two well-known effects of dispersal are spatial synchrony (positively correlated population dynamics at different points in space) and dispersal-induced stability (the phenomenon whereby populations have simpler or less extinction-prone dynamics when they are linked by dispersal than when they are isolated). Although both these effects of dispersal should occur simultaneously, they have primarily been studied separately. Herein, I summarise evidence from the literature that these effects are expected to interact, and I use a series of models to characterise that interaction. In particular, I explore the observation that although dispersal can promote both synchrony and stability singly, it is widely held that synchrony paradoxically prevents dispersal-induced stability. I show here that in many realistic scenarios, dispersal is expected to promote both synchrony and stability at once despite this apparent destabilising influence of synchrony. This work demonstrates that studying the spatial and temporal impacts of dispersal together will be vital for the conservation and management of the many communities for which human activities are altering natural dispersal rates. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

@article{Zelnik2019,
   abstract = {An enduring challenge for ecology is identifying the drivers of ecosystem and population stability. In a spatially explicit context, key features to consider are landscape spatial structure, local interactions, and dispersal. Substantial work has been done on each of these features as a driver of stability, but little is known on the interplay between them. Missing has been a more integrative approach, able to map and identify different dynamical regimes, predicting a system's response to perturbations. Here we first consider a simple scenario, i.e., the recovery of a homogeneous metapopulation from a single localized pulse disturbance. The analysis of this scenario reveals three fundamental recovery regimes: Isolated Regime when dispersal is not significant, Rescue Regime when dispersal mediates recovery, and Mixing Regime when perturbations spread throughout the system. Despite its simplicity, our approach leads to remarkably general predictions. These include the qualitatively different outcomes of various scenarios of habitat fragmentation, the surprising benefits of local extinctions on population persistence at the transition between regimes, and the productivity shifts of metacommunities in a changing environment. This study thus provides context to known results and insight into future directions of research.},
